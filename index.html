    <h3>Q-1 what are promises and why we need them?</h3>
    <h4>
      A JavaScript Promise object can be: Pending Fulfilled Rejected The Promise
      object supports two properties: state and result. While a Promise object
      is "pending" (working), the result is undefined. When a Promise object is
      "fulfilled", the result is a value. When a Promise object is "rejected",
      the result is an error object.

    <pre>
function myDisplayer(some) {
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = some;
          }
          
          let myPromise = new Promise(function(myResolve, myReject) {
            let x = 0;
          
          // some code (try to change x to 5)
          
            if (x == 0) {
              myResolve("OK");
            } else {
              myReject("Error");
            }
          });
          
          myPromise.then(
            function(value) {myDisplayer(value);},
            function(error) {myDisplayer(error);}
          );</pre

    <h3>Q-2 Promise chaining?</h3>
    <h4>
      Promises are useful when you have to handle more than one asynchronous
      task, one after another. For that, we use promise chaining
    </h4>
    <pre>
  let countValue = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
        resolve("Promise resolved");
      });
      
      // executes when promise is resolved successfully
      
      countValue
        .then(function successValue(result) {
          console.log(result);
        })
      
        .then(function successValue1() {
          console.log("You can call multiple functions this way.");
        });</pre

    <h3>Q-3 DOM</h3>
    <h4>
      DOM - The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web
      documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document
      structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes
      and objects, and that way, programming languages can interact with the
      page. The Document Object represents the whole html document. When an html
      document is loaded in the browser, it becomes a document object. It is the
      root element that represents the html document. It has properties and
      methods. By the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content to
      our web page.

    <h3>Q-4 Operators</h3>
    <h4>
      There are seven types of operators- (a)Arithmetic Operators - These are
      used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction,
      multiplication, and division. (b)Comparison Operators - These are used to
      compare two values and return a Boolean value (true or false) (c)Logical
      Operators - These are used to perform logical operations such as AND (&&),
      OR (||), and NOT (!). (d)Bitwise Operators - These are used to perform
      bitwise operations on binary numbers. (e)Conditional (ternary) operator -
      This operator allows for a concise way of writing an if...else statement.
      (f)Type Operator - Type Operators: These are used to determine the type of
      a value. The most common type operator is typeof. (g) Assignment Operators
      - These are used to assign values to variables.

    <h3>Q-5 Closures</h3>
    <h4>
      Closure - A closure can be defined as a JavaScript feature in which the
      inner function has access to the outer function variable. In JavaScript,
      every time a closure is created with the creation of a function. The
      closure has three scope chains listed as follows: Access to its own scope.
      Access to the variables of the outer function. Access to the global
      variables.

    <pre> function hii() {
      let b = 1;
      function inner() {
          return b;
      }
      return inner;
  }
  let get_func_inner = hii();
   
  console.log(get_func_inner());
  console.log(get_func_inner());
  console.log(get_func_inner()); </pre>

    <h3>Q-6 Objects</h3>
    <h4>
      The Object type represents one of JavaScript's data types. It is used to
      store various keyed collections and more complex entities. Objects can be
      created using the Object() constructor or the object initializer / literal
      syntax
